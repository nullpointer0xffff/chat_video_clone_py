Summary: The text explains decision trees, specifically classification trees, and their construction using raw data. It highlights the use of genie impurity to quantify differences between features and addresses overfitting and impure leaves through pruning and limiting tree growth, with cross-validation for testing different values.
Key questions answered: 
1. What is the purpose of genie impurity in decision trees?:
 Genie impurity quantifies the impurity of leaves in a decision tree, helping to decide which feature should be at the top of the tree.
2. What are two methods to address overfitting and impure leaves in classification trees?:
 Pruning and limiting tree growth.
3. What technique is suggested for testing different values in tree growth limitations?:
 Cross-validation.

Give me a question about this video: 
what's the advantage of using genie impurity in decition tree? if not show in the content, can you still tell?
Answer:  The content provided does not explicitly mention the advantages of using genie impurity in decision trees. However, I can still tell you that genie impurity is a measure used to determine the best split in decision trees by evaluating the purity of a node. The lower the genie impurity, the better the split. It helps to create more accurate and efficient decision trees.
